Helix Launcher is a Minecraft launcher written from scratch in [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)). It aims to put common user needs first -- such as accessibility, [software freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), and fine-grained control.

That's a lot of buzzwords, we know ^^.
